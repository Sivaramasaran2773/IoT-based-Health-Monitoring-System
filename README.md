# IoT-based-Health-Monitoring-System
The goal of this extensive and ground-breaking project is to transform healthcare through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This open-source project is for real-time health monitoring, enabling remote tracking and analysis of critical health parameters like BPM and body Temperature.

### Hardware Components
* Arduino UNO Board
* ESP8266-01 Module
* LCD Display
* Pulse Sensor
* DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
* DC Buzzer
* Potentiometer-10k pot
* 4.7K&100 ohm Resistor

### Key Steps
1. Assembling the sensors with the Arduino Board
2. Creating a ThingSpeak Server and Configuring ESP8266-01
3. Coding and Uploading to the Arduino UNO and Transmitting data to ThingSpeak Server.
4. Creating IFTTT Applets and Integrating with ThingSpeak Server
